# JavaFundamentals-TooLargeTooSmall

* **Objective** - To create an `InputEvaluator` which is capable of identifying valid-user-names.
* **Purpose**
    * To establish familiarity with
        * Control Flow
        * Conditionals
        * `Scanner` object
        * `Random` object
* **Description**
    * You are provided with a java class named `InputEvaluator`
    * Your objective is to complete the `run` method by following the line-by-line comments describing the algorithm to be implemented
    * In short, our objective is:
        * Write a program which prompts the user to guess a randomly selected value within a _range_. 
        * The program should count the number of times a user guesses.
            * if a user enters the same guess multiple times, then the program does not increment the number of guesses.
